# Run the htmlproofer utility with some pre-set options, including some example
# ignores.

# Ignoring 429's is important because github throttles very aggressively, so
# pretty much all github links get a 429 ðŸ˜ž.
#
# Ignoring 999's is important because some sites (like linkedin) return 999's
# for curl. Can probably tweak user agent to work around but ðŸ¤·
